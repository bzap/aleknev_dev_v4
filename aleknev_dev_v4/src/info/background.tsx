and a full-stack Software Developer for AviaPro Consulting Inc. While I constantly try to challenge myself and keep up with any advancements in this field, I also happen to have a soft spot for front-end designs and implementations.

endgame mechanical keyboard. The latter of which I\'ve come to think of as a paradox by now. Ask me about the builds I have (or have had in the past)!
\nCurrently I\'m looking for new opportunities as a developer! Hire me?`;
